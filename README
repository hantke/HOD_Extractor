HOD_Extractor

This code extracts the HOD for a given redshift and number density.

To run:
> python HOD_Extractor.py  sn_id  nd_id  gp_id  hp_id  index

with:

- sn_id (int) between 0 and 6. The index of the redshift of the sample, with 
  0 -> z=0, 1-> z=0.5, 1 -> z=1 ... 6 -> z=3

- nd_id (int) between 0 and 5. The index of the number density of the sample, 
  with 0 -> n= 0.0316, 1 -> n=0.01, 2-> n=0.00316, 3 -> n=0.001, 4 -> n=0.000316, 
  5-> n=0.0001 h^-3 Mpc^3

- gp_id (int) between 0 and 1. If it is '0', the samples are selected using the 
  most massive galaxies in stellar mass. if it is '1' the samples are selected using 
  the galaxies with the highest SFR.
  
- hp_id (int) between 0 and 1. If it is '0' we select haloes in function of their 
  formation redshift. If it is '1' we select haloes in function of their concentration.
  
- index (int) between 0 and 10, if it is '0' we use the full galaxy catalogue. If 
  it is '1' we select the galaxies in the haloes with 10% lowest formation redshift/concentration. 
  If it is '2' we select the galaxies in the haloes with that have its formation 
  redshift/concentration between the bottom 10%-20% of the distribution... if it is '9' 
  we select the galaxies in the haloes with that have its formation redshift/concentration 
  between the highest 10%-20% of the distribution. If it is '10'we select the galaxies in 
  the haloes with 10% highest formation redshift/concentration.

The exit of the codes are 5 columns:

- log_Mhalo (float) The logarithm of the mass of the halo, in units of h^-1 Msun.

- <Ngal> (float) The average number of galaxies that populate a halo of a given mass.

- <Ncen> (float) The average number of central galaxies that populate a halo of a given mass.

- <Nsat> (float) The average number of satellite galaxies that populate a halo of a given mass.

- Nhaloes (int) The total number of haloes in this mass bin.

Fit_Extractor

This code extracts the fitting parameters of the HOD for a given redshift and number density,
using the parametrisation introduced by Zheng et al. 2005.
To run:
> python HOD_Extractor.py  sn_id  nd_id   hp_id  index
# Note that this is only for galaxy samples selected by their stellar mass

with:

- sn_id (int) between 0 and 6. The index of the redshift of the sample, with 
  0 -> z=0, 1-> z=0.5, 1 -> z=1 ... 6 -> z=3

- nd_id (int) between 0 and 5. The index of the number density of the sample, 
  with 0 -> n= 0.0316, 1 -> n=0.01, 2-> n=0.00316, 3 -> n=0.001, 4 -> n=0.000316, 
  5-> n=0.0001 h^-3 Mpc^3

- hp_id (int) between 0 and 1. If it is '0' we select haloes in function of their 
  formation redshift. If it is '1' we select haloes in function of their concentration.
  
- index (int) between 0 and 10, if it is '0' we use the full galaxy catalogue. If 
  it is '1' we select the galaxies in the haloes with 10% lowest formation redshift/concentration. 
  If it is '2' we select the galaxies in the haloes with that have its formation 
  redshift/concentration between the bottom 10%-20% of the distribution... if it is '9' 
  we select the galaxies in the haloes with that have its formation redshift/concentration 
  between the highest 10%-20% of the distribution. If it is '10'we select the galaxies in 
  the haloes with 10% highest formation redshift/concentration.

The exit of the codes are 10 columns:

- Mmin, in units of h^-1 Msun

- sigmaLogM

- Mcut, in units of h^-1 Msun

- M1, in units of h^-1 Msun

- alpha

- Err_Mmin
